# Ralph - Autonomous Development Agent

This directory contains files for **Ralph**, an autonomous AI development agent that incrementally implements features from Product Requirements Documents (PRDs).

## Files

### Core Files

- **prd.json** - Task tracking with user stories, priorities, and completion status
- **progress.txt** - Append-only learning journal documenting completed work and patterns discovered
- **prompt.md** - Instructions for Ralph agent
- **prompt.example-rails.md** - Rails-specific example implementation
- **ralph.sh** - Bash script for automated loop execution

### Usage

## VS Code Copilot Integration (Recommended)

Ralph can be integrated into VS Code Copilot via custom instructions:

1. **Setup** (one-time):

   - Add custom instructions to `/.github/copilot-instructions.md`
   - Include Ralph patterns in `/AGENTS.md`

2. **Use Ralph**:

   - Run `./ralph.sh [max_iterations]` OR use VS Code Copilot Chat
   - Say "Start working on the PRD" or "Go"
   - Ralph will automatically:
     - Read `prd.json` for incomplete stories
     - Read `progress.txt` for previous learnings
     - Select highest-priority incomplete story
     - Implement it completely
     - Run quality checks (linting + tests)
     - Commit if passing
     - Update `prd.json` and `progress.txt`

3. **Monitor Progress**:

   ```bash
   # View completion status
   cat prd.json | jq '.userStories[] | select(.passes == true) | .title'

   # View remaining tasks
   cat prd.json | jq '.userStories[] | select(.passes == false) | {id, title, priority}'

   # Recent learnings
   tail -n 50 progress.txt
   ```

## Automated Loop Workflow

Ralph can run as an automated bash loop using multiple AI providers:

```bash
# Run Ralph in loop mode (max 10 iterations)
./ralph.sh 10

# Run with custom max iterations
./ralph.sh 20
```

**How it works:**

1. Loop reads `prd.json` to find incomplete stories
2. Selects best available provider (checks amp, claude, copilot in order)
3. Invokes provider with `prompt.md` as instructions
4. Agent implements one story, runs tests, commits
5. Agent updates `prd.json` and `progress.txt`
6. Loop continues until all stories pass or max iterations reached
7. Agent outputs `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` when done

**Provider Selection:**

- Checks each provider for available credits/capacity
- Prefers: amp → claude → copilot
- Falls back gracefully if a provider is rate-limited
- Waits 5 minutes and retries if all providers unavailable

### Enhanced UI (Optional)

For a more polished terminal experience with animated spinners and live status updates, use the Ink-based TypeScript version:

**Setup** (one-time):

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

**Run:**

```bash
npm start 10        # Run with max 10 iterations
npm run dev 25      # Build and run with max 25 iterations
```

**Features:**

- ✨ Animated spinner while agent works
- 🎨 Color-coded status messages
- 📊 Real-time iteration progress
- 🎉 Celebration on completion

The Ink version provides the same functionality as `ralph.sh` with a modern CLI interface. Both versions use the same `prd.json`, `progress.txt`, and `prompt.md` files.

## prd.json Structure

```json
{
  "project": "MyApp",
  "branchName": "ralph/feature-name",
  "description": "High-level feature description",
  "userStories": [
    {
      "id": "US-001",
      "title": "Short story title",
      "description": "As a... I want... So that...",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Specific requirement 1",
        "Specific requirement 2"
      ],
      "priority": 1,
      "passes": false,
      "notes": "Additional context"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key Fields:**

- `passes: false` - Story incomplete, Ralph should work on it
- `passes: true` - Story complete, Ralph skips it
- `priority` - Lower numbers = higher priority (1 is highest)

## progress.txt Format

Ralph appends entries after completing each story:

```
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] Story: <story title>
Implemented: <what was built>
Files: <list of modified files>
Tests: PASSING
Learnings:
- <reusable pattern discovered>
- <gotcha or constraint found>
```

**Purpose:**

- Provides learning continuity across agent sessions
- Documents patterns for future work
- Helps debug issues from previous iterations
- Serves as lightweight change log

## Ralph's Workflow

### 1. Context Gathering

- Reads `prd.json` for tasks
- Reads `progress.txt` for learnings
- Reviews git history
- Checks `AGENTS.md` files for patterns

### 2. Task Selection

- Finds highest-priority story where `passes: false`
- Works on ONE story at a time

### 3. Implementation

- Searches codebase for existing patterns
- Follows Rails conventions
- Implements feature completely

### 4. Quality Gates (MUST PASS)

```bash
# Linting
bundle exec rubocop --autocorrect

# Tests (excluding system tests)
bundle exec rspec --exclude-pattern="spec/system/**/*_spec.rb"
```

### 5. Documentation

- Commits changes with proper format
- Updates story to `passes: true` in prd.json
- Appends learnings to progress.txt

### 6. Complete

When all stories have `passes: true`, Ralph reports completion

## Creating a New PRD

1. **Copy template:**

   ```bash
   cp prd.json prd-new-feature.json
   ```

2. **Edit fields:**

   - Update `branchName` to `ralph/feature-name`
   - Update `description`
   - Define `userStories` with priorities

3. **Create branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b ralph/feature-name
   ```

4. **Start Ralph:**
   - VS Code: Point Ralph at new PRD file
   - Bash: `./ralph.sh 10` (after updating script to use new file)

## Quality Standards

All Ralph commits must pass:

- ✅ Linting: `bundle exec rubocop --autocorrect`
- ✅ Tests: `bundle exec rspec --exclude-pattern="spec/system/**/*_spec.rb"`
- ✅ No failures or errors

## Git Commit Format

```
<type>: <description>

Co-Authored-By: Ralph (Autonomous Agent) <ralph@example.com>
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`

## Tips

- **One story per session** - Ralph focuses on complete implementation
- **Search before coding** - Ralph looks for existing patterns first
- **Quality first** - Never commit broken code
- **Document learnings** - Help future Ralph iterations

## Archiving

When switching to a new PRD, the bash script automatically archives:

- Previous `prd.json`
- Previous `progress.txt`

Archives go to: `scripts/ralph/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/`
